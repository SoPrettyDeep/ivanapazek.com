For most of them, this means losing faith in themselves, without experiencing a permanent change. They may feel happy for a while, but it doesn’t take long until they crash back. This makes them stop believing it’s possible for them and they continue doing things they don’t want to do, like a job they hate or meeting people they don't really like.</p>

                        <p class="service__content"> It goes on and on until one day they wake up and realize that they wasted so much time. And even when they start living the life of their dreams, they feel regret for not living it sooner.</p>

                    <br> The reason for hiring her is because I also admire everything she has accomplished in her own life! Her amazing connection with her husband, great job and career path, amazing body, her expansion of always learning and having her own coach, her happy clients... That's what gives me even more credibility for her talent to assist people and transform their career in gentle and such a pleasant way!</div>

                    <br/> I would DEFINITELY recommend Ivana as a coach.

                    <br> She is very sensitive and knows immediately what is the essence of a problem. She is always extremely positive, encouraging, supportive, and she never judges you. And the most important is that she never gives you any advice, but she gives the tools to transform on your own. Today I have a huge confidence not only in my career as an actress but in my life. Last month I got 5 auditions, it didn’t happened once in my whole life. I wanted to travel a lot, and this last 3 months I have been in 5 differents countries. I know that step by step, I am building the life of my dreams. I have overcome a death grief. It was probably the most powerful session we had. My life is totally different since this day. I have stopped smoking.

                    <br> I got so much than I was assigned for. I am today totally conscious of my power to not only make my dream career a reality but everything else I want in life. So now, nothing can stop me. This is my biggest victory.</div>

                    <br/>Ivana has this warm and gentle persona that creates the perfect atmosphere for learning and changing. She asks great questions and really listens, which is probably why she comes up with just the right words - no matter if the group setting or 1-1.

                    <br> Would definitely recommend! </div>

                    <br/> The improvements I gained during and after working with Ivana are multi-layered.

                    <br> She guided me with practical life tools to help me navigate and solve issues in many aspects of my life including from my heart and mind. She re-inforced my belief so that I could look at my future work with faith and trust.

                    <br> In working with Ivana, I gained clarity on the nature of life, setting boundaries and knowing that as long as you believe, you will receive.

                    <p> Ivana Pazek is a transformational leader, podcast host, and author known for the Two Corporate Personality Types theory. Starting her career in ICT, Ivana became deeply interested in how we work within organizations at various levels and in team dynamics. </p>

                    <p> This led to knowledge, research, and discovery into the role we each play in creating the best (or worst) working conditions, and how to (successfully) navigate and improve. In her books, Ivana emphasizes mindset agility and the 'inner' shift necessary for any sustainable 'outer' change. </p>

                    <p>In the summer of 2018, Ivana moved to China, Shanghai, to pursue her love for coaching and growth facilitation in multinational corporations.</p>
		    
		    <p>Ivana is also a social media influencer, who moved from 500 to ~50000 followers in one year. Follow Ivana on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/ivanapazek/"><font color="red">personal</font></a>

                        <!--<p class="service__content"> The bad news is that most people find it difficult to ask for help and just go on their own. For most of them, this means losing faith in themselves, without experiencing a permanent change. They may feel happy for a while, but it doesn’t take long until they crash back. This makes them stop believing it’s possible for them and they continue doing things they don’t want to do, like a job they hate or meeting people they don't really like.</p>

                        <p class="service__content"> It goes on and on until one day they wake up and realize that they wasted so much time. And even when they start living the life of their dreams, they feel regret for not living it sooner.</p>

                        <p class="service__content bold"> Wouldn’t you like to start creating the life of your dreams right now?

                        </p>

                        <p class="service__content"> When you decide to contact me, here is what is going to happen: We will have a free Career Assessment session. In this session, you will discover:

                            <p class="service__content bold red">-3 things keeping you from living more joyful, purpose driven life and </p>

                            <p class="service__content bold red">-very 1st thing to do that will permanently change your life for the better. </p>

                <div class="col-md-4">Svetlana Illieva, Germany</div>

                <div class="col-md-8 work__text">Ivana gave me this amazing feeling of "being home with a friend". I felt that the minute I heard her voice a year ago. Getting better and better-it is really possible with her. I’ve completely changed my relationships with my relatives, friends and clients. The money can come and STAY with me, with my Man. Permanently, it is not possible to go back. And I do not want to, for it unfolds Great now (-:

                    <br> Her calm and light nature, combined with these constant flashes of insights were shocking (in >>The Best<< meaning of the word). Ivana is a treasure to get to know as a coach. More than anything I am proud of my ability to have Ivana as my coach. It means I am choosing the very best! (-:

                    <br> The reason for hiring her is because I also admire everything she has accomplished in her own life! Her amazing connection with her husband, great job and career path, amazing body, her expansion of always learning and having her own coach, her happy clients... That's what gives me even more credibility for her talent to assist people and transform their career in gentle and such a pleasant way!</div>

                <div class="col-md-8 work__text work__text__hoda">

                    <br/> I would DEFINITELY recommend Ivana as a coach.

                    <br> She is very sensitive and knows immediately what is the essence of a problem. She is always extremely positive, encouraging, supportive, and she never judges you. And the most important is that she never gives you any advice, but she gives the tools to transform on your own. Today I have a huge confidence not only in my career as an actress but in my life. Last month I got 5 auditions, it didn’t happened once in my whole life. I wanted to travel a lot, and this last 3 months I have been in 5 differents countries. I know that step by step, I am building the life of my dreams. I have overcome a death grief. It was probably the most powerful session we had. My life is totally different since this day. I have stopped smoking.

                    <br> I got so much than I was assigned for. I am today totally conscious of my power to not only make my dream career a reality but everything else I want in life. So now, nothing can stop me. This is my biggest victory.</div>

                <div class="col-md-8 work__text">

                    <br/>Ivana has this warm and gentle persona that creates the perfect atmosphere for learning and changing. She asks great questions and really listens, which is probably why she comes up with just the right words - no matter if the group setting or 1-1.

                    <br> Would definitely recommend! </div>

                <div class="col-md-8 work__text">

                    <br/>

                    <br/> The improvements I gained during and after working with Ivana are multi-layered.

                    <br> She guided me with practical life tools to help me navigate and solve issues in many aspects of my life including from my heart and mind. She re-inforced my belief so that I could look at my future work with faith and trust.

                    <br> In working with Ivana, I gained clarity on the nature of life, setting boundaries and knowing that as long as you believe, you will receive.

                        <p class="journal_post">

                            Ever since I can remember, I was interested in spending time with just a small number of people. Over the years, this was my sister, one friend in high school, one on the University, my husband,. . . (<span class="italic">In case you are wondering:</span> the friend from University and my husband are not the same person, so we can say 2 from the University. :))

                        </p>

                        <p class="journal_post">

                            For all others, I felt like I could read them, and didn’t want to spend time with them. It wasn’t like they were bad people, but I could immediately say that they were not a company for me.

                        </p>

                        <p class="journal_post">

                            Now, when I believe to be more spiritually conscious, my ability to read other people seems to got enhanced even more. It is like I know their thoughts, and thus their intention <span class="italic">immediately</span> – when they speak, or look at me, or just send me a message.

                        </p>

                        <p class="journal_post">

                            For example, when someone doesn’t have good intentions, I feel their negativity. If I pay attention to it, I feel it <span class="italic">very</span> strongly. This is why I needed to learn a way to quickly release it and come back to my inner state of <span class="bold">alignment</span>.

                        </p>

                        <p class="journal_post">

                            There are some people who believe I’m simply ignorant to their negativity, since I don’t return it. The truth is, I’m conscious of it, but choose not to <span class="bold">focus</span> on it. It is my decision to not be in that energy for long.

                        </p>

                        <p class="journal_post">

                            Lately, I come to the point when I cannot speak badly about someone without feeling real pain. It is true that I also talked badly about others before (who didn’t:)) but now it amazes me to see other people still doing it. It’s because I now know how much we hurt ourselves by belittling, or wanting to hurt others.

                        </p>

                        <p class="journal_post">

                            Our <span class="bold">words</span> are indeed <span class="bold">powerful</span>. If you heard it from me, or someone else, it is completely true. By comparing with others and playing the <span class="bold">comparison game</span>, we hurt ourselves badly.

                        </p>

                        <p class="journal_post">

                            <span class="italic bold">Takeaway from this post</span>: Just a little word we say can carry a powerful bruising energy, which not only hurts ourselves, but also hinders the <span class="bold">manifestation process</span> of the lives we really want to live.

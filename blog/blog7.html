<h3 class="graf graf--h3" name="4413">The connection between the work personality types and your health, that is Heart vs. Brain</h3>
<p><br/></p>
     <p>                             
How you deal with difficult situations may not be the same as how someone else deals with them. You may have had your suspicions about how stress and toxic environments may impact your health, including the weak and strong points of each personality and your natural tendency to approach a situation in a certain way, which is the topic we are discussing in the following article.

<p class="p1">Introduction</p>
<p class="p1">The most relevant situation I noticed while researching personality types is how they deal with serious issues, such as constant pressure or illness. Although it may not be nice going through it yourself, I found that how you deal with challenges can reveal the core of your personality. For example, you may become aware of what truly matters, what is the most precious thing for you to protect and preserve, including the different parts of your body.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1"><strong>The core of your personality represented as an organ in your body</strong></p>
<p class="p1">If you needed to preserve one part of your body, your heart or your brain, which would it be?&nbsp;</p>
<p class="p1">The question may appear to be answerable differently, at different times, or through different lenses - putting this all aside, let&rsquo;s start this introspection from your current answer.</p>
<p class="p1">Did your answer come easily, or did you have difficulty choosing?</p>
<p class="p1">Many may choose the brain, due to the current cultural or social influences, or view the heart as replaceable through the advancements in technology. However, up until today, if you replace the heart, it would mean replacing it with the heart tissues of another person. In turn, you may not feel fully like yourself. In addition, despite all the positive notions logic receives, the only thing at this point (that we may be conscious of) that distinguishes us from robots is not our thoughts or our logic, but our emotions.</p>
<p class="p1">Even if you had your answer immediately, it may still be a difficult thing to choose. And not necessarily how your body would naturally behave if given a choice. To find our deeper answer to that question, we will take a look at your past data, namely your family history records.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1"><strong>The brain or the heart?</strong></p>
<p class="p1">Looking back at your recent, or not-so-recent diseases, which body parts were the most prevalent to cause an issue? For simplicity, we will consider only heart/lung and brain diseases. It may be difficult to sometimes point out the cause since people before didn&rsquo;t have the technology, but you may still have some ideas.</p>
<p class="p1">Usually, these are the organs that &lsquo;caused&rsquo; the death or were pointed out as at fault.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="p1">However, I would look at this slightly differently. I wouldn&rsquo;t necessarily mark that disease or an organ as meaning what most would say it means: your weak end. I would argue that this particular organ is, in fact, the healthiest part of you. If you come to the point of damaging it, all the others break apart.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1"><strong>Health and the signs of disbalance&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p class="p1">Paying attention to your health is not just related to organs, although this makes us look more closely since it&rsquo;s what we can see. I would say that things start to fall apart on other plains first, long before it becomes visible. Other plains include your spiritual, mental, and emotional body. These plains warn you in advance of things being imbalanced. The signs? Muted or negative emotions and thoughts. What I mean by muted is that you have a feeling like you are not feeling at all; you are not processing your emotions in a healthy way. You are disconnected. On a mental plane, you see things not as they are but distorted. It is not clarity, but an unhealthy detachment. Negative or unprocessed feelings accumulate toxicity in your body.</p>
<p class="p1">The first signs of disbalance? For simplicity, we will use the two personality types theory to describe it. I talk about it in my book, Live Your True Calling: From a Job That&rsquo;s Eating You Alive to The Life You Love. If your soul needed to come into a two-dimensional reality, it would be either 0 or 1. In practical terms, in the work environment, it would mean that under constant pressure and stress, you would either turn against yourself (Team Player Personality/team players) or others, and the environment you are in (leadership personality/leaders). In that sense, you would either have a disbalance in your left hemisphere, denoting linearity and stability (heart/team players) or the right brain, dealing with nonlinearity and instability (brain/leaders). The reason we are observing the brain is because it has an important function. Our brain is the main controller of our organs and is responsible for the function of all other organs.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="p1">The heart denotes stability since, in order to function well, its pattern needs to remain regular. On the other hand, the brain requires instability to function. If it would become regular, you would experience epilepsy (best case scenario).</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1"><strong>Physical Symptoms of the Two Personality Types</strong></p>
<p class="p1">Note: This theory is under development, and I didn&rsquo;t yet have time to investigate it in all aspects. Please take it as a helper, not as a complete truth in your understanding of yourself and situations in your career and life.</p>
<p class="p1">In that sense, for leaders, the healthiest organ, and the last one to go down in sickness is the brain; the leaders&rsquo; resting place being unpredictability. They first turn against their environment, in this sense, their body. The most prevalent early symptom of an imbalanced leader is impulsiveness. They are so imbalanced that they don&rsquo;t think at all; they only act. Their feelings are more muted than felt.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="p1">For the team players, it&rsquo;s the opposite. Their resting place is a sense of order, and the healthiest organ is the heart, and if it goes down, all else goes down. Other organs also play a big role for team players, such as the lungs. For team players, the main early symptom is feeling overwhelmed by emotions and overthinking.</p>
<p class="p1">Following this logic, the healthiest part of each personality type is what stays the last. The problems regarding the organ (s) may not be visible unless the situation gets serious and you are holding on to the last thread of life and death. In the meantime, there are other symptoms, and you guessed it. They come from other planes.</p>
<p class="p3"><br></p>
<p class="p1"><strong>Other planes</strong></p>
<p class="p1">On the spiritual, mental, and emotional plane, the first symptoms of disbalance, or dis-ease, are visible long before there are serious symptoms in your body (although your body can also be a great guide if you learn to pay attention to its messages).</p>
<p class="p1">In this article, we will not go into the depth of describing all the symptoms but will focus just on a main few. The main symptom for the leader, as described above, are muted feelings and non-thinking. Its consequence is impulsiveness, or &lsquo;not thinking before you act. It may seem that people with this imbalance, or if you observe yourself in retrospect, didn&rsquo;t think at all. You may be surprised since it seems completely irrational. And this is because it was.</p>
<p class="p1">For the team player, the early symptoms include overthinking and being overwhelmed with emotions. This means being only in their brain, and out of their body. As we mentioned, the first symptoms are outside of the organs that are the core of their personality.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1"><strong>Fractals and inner patterns</strong></p>
<p class="p1">Another interesting thing is that your heart, together with your lungs, as well as your brain, forms an interesting pattern known in nature (and mathematics) as fractal. Its structure denotes that what is bigger is also represented in a smaller form. For example, the branches of a tree can have smaller branches, which again have even smaller branches, etc. There are many things in nature that form this pattern, including plants and states of (frozen) water.<span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p1">Understanding the fractal nature of our organs could point us in the right direction. Either big or small imbalances matter since they are reflected in the whole. Once the big disbalance happens, it may be difficult, if not impossible, to counter it with small steps. It is as we heard it: the best intervention is prevention.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p4"><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
<p class="p1">If there is a small disbalance, it always pays to pay attention. The nuances point to the bigger picture of the imbalance. Your career challenges, no matter if it&rsquo;s the case with experiencing a toxic work environment or inability to find (a lasting) employment, all start from the inside. The way you acknowledge your emotions and inner states impact all plans of who you are, non excluding the physical. This is why the healing of the planes, that underline the invisible structure of your body, is crucial in recovery, as well as in maintaining your health.</p>

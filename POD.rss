    <title>Pod #17: Non-resistance & Go, Part 1</title>



    <itunes:summary>


 In the first recording of the last part of the STOPPING process, we talk about the importance of Non-resistance - to what is currently in our life, to what happened, what we expect to happen, as well as non-resistance to who we are.  
 The Non-resistance encompasses all we learned so far and is a prerequisit to taking any conscious decision or action.
